# leaflet-challenge-part-2

This coding challenge involves data analysis implementing interactive visualizations primarily through the use of coding environments and tools of HTML, JavaScript, and Leaflet.

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it.

The challenge includes the buildout of a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

Limitations and other considerations:
- The color range used for the circle marker fill colors is related to the depth and destruction capability of the event, with red indicating those quakes that are shallow and are more likely to be destructuve and green for those that are deep underground and are less likely to be destructive.

- Data obtained for the tectonic plates was obtained from https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates
